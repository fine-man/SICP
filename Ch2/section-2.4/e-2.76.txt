Expression Problem - https://wiki.c2.com/?ExpressionProblem

Explicit dispatching

1. adding new operation won't change the old code because for each type we would only
need to add another procedure for that particular operation and also a dispatch procedure
which would check the type of the data-object and apply the approriate procedure for that operation

2. in adding new types, we would have to change the all the old dispatching functions 
to include a special condition for the new type


Message Passing

1. adding new operations, as in the message passing style the data-objects are themselves
procedures that take the operation to be applied as inputs and so for adding any new 
functionality we would need to change the definitions of all the different types itself
to add a condition for this new function/operation

2. for adding new types we won't have to change the old code at all, we would just have to
define the procedural definition of the new type including all the different operations on that type


Data Directed programming

1. Because of the lookup table structure of data directed programming, adding a new operation
just becomes adding/"putting" a new row in the table which would contain the procedures for 
the new operation on each type

2. The lookup table structure also allows add new types without changing the old code, to add a
new type we just have to create a new column which would contain all the operation procedures
on the new type and 'put' in the table
