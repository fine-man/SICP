Solution to exercise 2.71 of SICP
http://community.schemewiki.org/?sicp-ex-2.71

Tree for n = 5:
let the set of symbols be ((A 1) (B 2) (C 4) (D 8) (E 16))

{A B C D E} 31
	/  \
E 16    {A B C D} 15
		   /  \
		D 8    {A B C} 7
				 /  \
			  C 4	 {A B} 3
					  /  \
				   B 2	  A 1

The Tree for n = 10 will look similar but it will just be bigger.
The number of bits required to encode the the most frequent symbol
(i.e - the one with weight 2 ^ (n - 1)) will be 1 bit

The number of bits requires to encode the least frequent symbol will be (n - 1) bits
